## Decentralized Fixed Rate Lending Marketplace

The concept is to create a marketplace that connects borrowers with lenders. Borrowers create a proposed loan with the amount requested to borrow and the lenders can bid on the loan giving the borrower the lowest possible APR. Lenders are able to make yield on their assets. This provides a mutual beneficial marketplace for both lenders and borrowers. The market place will also feature account history for both borrowers and lenders. This provides context about the loan. For example if a user is brand new and has no history it is unlikely a lender will take a risk on them without having credible history of repayments. However this alone does not guarantee the loan will be repaid, a borrower is also capable of attaching collateral amount before submitting their proposed loan. These two mechanisms provide context and more certainty about the loan however is no guarantee the loan will be repaid. For this reason the platform is designed at as "lend-at-your-own-risk" methodology. 


Example 1: 

John requests a loan of $1,000 USDC for a period of 3 months. Mary places a bid on the loan saying she will provide the $1,000 USDC for 3 months with a 5.0% APR rate. This bid is then finalized after a period. 


Example 2: 
Mark a new user to the platform requests a loan of $1M USDC for 12 months. Lenders see that he has no history and chose to ignore his request. However Eli has requested several small loans over the course of a year and how has established history. Over the last year Eli has borrowed and repaid a total of $500k in loans. Eli requests a slightly larger loan normal of him, for $50k USDC. Lenders although weary of lending out a larger loan of $50k USDC, see that Eli has established a history not only of total loaned amount, but also repayment history as well. Macie a lender, believes this is sufficient but still on the more risky side, so she places a bid with a rate of 7.5% APR because of the larger loan amount.  

Example 3: 
Joe has account history and requests a loan of 1,000,000,000 SHIBA. Although he has account history of repayments, Kelsey believes this loan is still a bit risky. As a result she bids on the loan for 6.0% APR and a collateral of 3wETH to help secure the loan. If Joe defaults on his payment, the collateral of 3wETH goes to Kelsey.
