## Decentralized Fixed Rate Lending Marketplace

The concept is to create a marketplace that connects borrowers with lenders. Borrowers create a proposed loan with the amount requested to borrow and the lenders can bid on the loan giving the borrower the lowest possible APR. Lenders are able to make yield on their assets. This provides a mutual beneficial marketplace for both lenders and borrowers.  To ensure the loan is repaid a borrower is also capable of attaching collateral amount before submitting their proposed loan. If the loan is not repaid in the duration of the proposed loan the lender and claim the collateral for themselves. A small platfrom fee is taken from the collateral as to provide support for the platform. 


Example 1: 

John requests a loan of $1,000 USDC for a period of 3 months. Mary places a bid on the loan saying she will provide the $1,000 USDC for 3 months with a 5.0% APR rate. This bid is then finalized after a period. John repaids the loan with a 5.0% the collateral is then transferred back to John. 
 

Example 2: 
Joe has account history and requests a loan of 1,000,000,000 SHIBA. Macy bids on the loan for 6.0% APR and a collateral of 3wETH to help secure the loan. Joe does not repay the loan in time so the 3wETH is then claimed by Macy.
